![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5233f86c-4f96-4e6e-a321-3ef997995f58)

This was my submission for the Front-End Frameworks course assignment, which is an online shop based on Noroffs Online Shop
API. 

## Description:

The project is an online shop, meant to be similar to Finn.no or other online shopping platforms. Actions users can make include:
- Searching for items
- Sorting items by price or popularity
- Adding items to carts and seeing the sum of all items in cart
- Removing items from cart
- Checking out

## Built with: 
- React
- Styled Components
- React hook form
- Yup
- React helmet
- Zustand
- Jest

## Getting started

First, clone the repo:
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git

Then use NPM i to install all dependencies  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
